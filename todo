# (rotate ghosts)
	# create ghosts look up / down sprites
# make ghosts semi-pathfind
# add food (power-up)
	# -> ability to kill ghosts after eating food
	# -> ghost respawn when killed
# improve scoring system
	can still be better
make player be part of map (spawn where he's put)
# block ghosts from going back into their spawn
# static highscore display
# local storage: store total games won
# alternative ghost movement behaviour when vulnerable
# respawn food or randomly spawn food
# refactor ghost vulnerabilty / player food mechanic
	# (it's a mess)
make game over or game won text overlap everything
add more maps
	maybe switch to different map when player wins
original pacman mechanic: double score gain for eating ghosts each time a ghost is eaten


(
lives
timer
increase difficulty after beating the game
# make ghosts wobble
# little score text floating upwards when gaining score
	# maybe only when food active
# find a method of making ghosts leave spawn asap
